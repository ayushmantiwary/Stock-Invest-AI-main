# Stock-Invest-AI

Develop a machine learning-based stock prediction system that can accurately predict
stock prices by analyzing a wide range of market data and identifying the key factors that
inﬂuence stock prices, while taking into account the volatility and uncertainty of the market.
Such a system would be valuable for investors and traders who want to make informed
decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks, as well as for ﬁnancial analysts who want
to provide accurate predictions and insights to their clients.
